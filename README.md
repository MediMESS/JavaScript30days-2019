# JavaScript30days-2019


#This is me doing the challenge made by Wesbos https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30 in 2017

The ones I didn't do, either they were the same as original cause i copy pasted from wesbos, or they just are done in consol because they were very fast tutorials so don't need to be pushed on git.
